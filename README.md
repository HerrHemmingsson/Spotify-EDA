# Spotify-EDA
An Exploratory Data Analysis of "Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks" at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

This was a small hobby project, trying to find some fun insights about music. I am a huge music nerd so this was rather entertaining.

### Key insights:
- Music have gotten quite a lot louder over the past years
- Explicit content has rapidly increased in songs (well, at least explicit-ratings of songs)
- Instrumental parts in songs have decreased heavily from ca 1950 to 2020.
- Danceability has increased from ca 0.45 in 1950 to almost 0.7 in 2020.
- Songs are shorter today, but this trend is rahter new. From 70's to late 00's, song duration was about the same. Since then, song duration is decreasing.
- Basshall and Turkish EDM are the two most popular genres on Spotify (according to this dataset). I'm sceptic about that one...
- Song popularity seems to mainly depend on energy, loudness, danceability and instrumentalness (negativly acousticness).
- Most popular aritsts on Spotify (according to this dataset) are Benny Blanco and Ritt Momney.
